            "Description: This rich anthology offers twenty studies on instances of emerging social justice and women’s empowerment in the Middle East, North Africa, and South Asia. These areas are home to huge populations where women’s rights have withered under patriarchal rule, and many are beset by civic unrest. The book shows how changes are occurring as flood tides of capital, people, and information erode entrenched gender regimes, giving birth to energetic and forward-thinking women’s movements. Highly original, conceptually sophisticated, and imminently readable, this book illustrates how local women are transforming their collective fates by questioning their status, forming alliances, demanding full participation in economic development and the political process, and mining opportunities afforded by globalization. \n",

            "Abstract: The issue of women's rights in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) has gained prominence in research studies, policy debates and feminist activism. Area experts contend that for women to play a larger role in the economy and society is vital to the region's progress. But women in MENA still face gender discrimination that prevents them from reaching their potential, despite impressive gains in education and health. To varying degrees across MENA countries, discrimination against women is built into cultural attitudes, government policies and legal frameworks. The region's family laws codify discrimination against women and girls, placing them in a position subordinate to men in the family – a position that is then replicated in the economy and society. I briefly discuss recent trends in women's activism and family law reform in the MENA region, with a spotlight on Morocco, which adopted an entirely new family law in early 2004. The new Moroccan law drew on international standards and norms on women's and children's rights, the imperatives of national development and Islam's spirit of justice and equality. That a feminist campaign succeeded in altering family law in a MENA country, where laws are based on Sharia, or Islamic law, shows that effective coalitions can be built in MENA countries by linking social and economic development to women's rights. The Moroccan case demonstrates the links among research, activism and policy. \n",

Although it is culturally diverse, this region shares many commonalities with relation to women that are strong, deep, and pervasive: a space-based patriarchy, a culturally strong sense of religion, a smooth co-existence of tradition and modernity, a transitional stage in development, and multilingualism/multiculturalism.\n",

            "Description: This clear and concise book examines the crucial relationship between globalization and social movements. Deftly combining nuanced theory with rich empirical examples, leading scholar Valentine M. Moghadam focuses especially on three transnational social movements-Islamism, feminism, and global justice. Defining globalization as a complex process in which the mobility of capital, peoples, organizations, movements, and ideas takes on an increasingly transnational form, the author shows how both physical and electronic mobility has helped to create dynamic global social movements. Globalization has engendered the spread of neoliberal capitalism across the world, but it also has engendered opposition and collective action. \n",

            "Abstract:  In the spring of 2011 when citizens in Arab countries rose up against their regimes, it appeared that the \"third wave\" of democratization had begun in the Middle East and the Maghreb, and that countries would embark on successful democratic transitions. Issues such as the gendered nature of the uprisings, how gender relations and women's mobilizations have shaped trajectories, as well as how women and their rights have been affected, have been under-researched. In this article, I put the spotlight on North Africa—Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco, and Tunisia—which saw different protest dynamics and political outcomes subsequently. Drawing from mainstream literature on determinants of democratization and feminist literature on women and democratic transitions, I examine how women's preexisting legal status and social positions, as well as the broad structural, institutional, and cultural contexts, shaped the course and immediate outcomes of the Arab Spring in the countries examined. I argue that those countries that saw advances in women's participation and rights prior to the Arab Spring are the ones most likely to transition successfully to democracy, and indeed, to establish a more women-friendly democracy; and that women's growing political leadership will influence the quality of ongoing democratizations in the Maghreb countries of Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia. \n",

We examine women's media activism and their roles in the region's social upheavals, with a focus on four cases: Iran's Green Protests and its feminist movement; the 2011 political revolutions in Tunisia and Egypt, and women's campaigns since then; and the gradualist movement in Morocco for women's rights and democratization. We show that women's cyber activism, their citizen journalism, and their self-organization both contribute to and reflect the social and political changes that have occurred in the region.\n",

            "Abstract: The process of demographic transition has increased the share of the working-age population in Middle East and North Africa (MENA). This situation has created an opportunity for economic growth, called the demographic dividend. Global comparisons show that a favorable age structure has not always resulted in a boost in economic growth. In order to take a full advantage of the MENA’s demographic dividend, it is important to identify different factors contributing to economic growth in this region. Investment in women’s human capital is expected to have important implications for the region’s economic growth and for maximizing the benefits created by the demographic dividend. Using a range of data sources, this paper aims to determine the association between women’s human capital (measured by adult educational attainment and health status) and economic growth (measured by gross national income per capita) in MENA. The findings show a positive association between these two. Specifically, the national-level income is generally higher in countries with lower maternal mortality and higher female literacy, female tertiary education, female life and healthy life expectancies at birth and professional childbirth attendance. Thus, investment in women’s human capital can accelerate the pace of development in MENA.  \n",

            "Abstract: This research explored whether the MENA region countries have adopted sufficient legal provisions that encouraged females to access the labor market. A documental collection, revision, and analysis were performed to enhance our understanding of statutory provisions that were adopted by 13 countries through the MENA region to encourage and facilitate access of women to the labor market. Findings showed that the governments of the different studied countries made considerable efforts to comply with the international legal norms and protect the female workers. Among other things, the findings suggest that the MENA countries need to offer more legal protections to guarantee equity between workers, maintain the principle to be treated equally without discrimination and facilitate access of women to the labor market. Additionally, legal frameworks, work-family policies as working from home and flexible working hours, need to become more coherent, and more effort needs to be directed towards proper implementation and practice primarily in the private sector. These findings also suggest a unified treatment between male and female workers, whether they work in the public or the private sector.  \n",

The article contributes to theory-building on (varieties of) gender regimes by underscoring (sub)regional specificities across the capitalist world-system’s economic zones and emphasizing the role of feminist activism. \n",
